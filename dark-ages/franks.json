They are recorded as being trained to easily mount or dismount their horses, and being well read in the tactics of other civilized peoples. The milites (Previously a Roman term for 'soldier) were a professional soldier class, who often fought on horseback, as had increasingly been the tradition and focus of the Franks over the previous few hundred years. While similar to the 'knights' of later periods, which this class would evolve into (Especially for the Normans), they focused less on the thrusting spear or lance, and more on the throwing spear and sword. Considering that some letters from the period require the milites to have a bow and javelin, and the common practice of nobles greatly enjoying hunting with bow and javelin, indicates that at least some of the mounted nobility must've been good with ranged weapons.",
