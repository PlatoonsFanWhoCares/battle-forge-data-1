By the time of Charlemagne, the 'Franci'/'Liberi' answering the Heerbann increasingly found themselves fighting without horses, and religated to paying for the equipment of the 'milities', which was quite expensive. This was a considerable burden to the poor landowners, basically low class 'freemen', who hoped to be under the service of a lord rich enough to, help them afford their obligations or ask less of them.",
