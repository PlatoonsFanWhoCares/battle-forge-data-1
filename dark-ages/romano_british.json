Despite the fact that these units were rarely deployed in 'the west', many of them had very obviously Gaulish names. It wouldn't be especially  hard for retired Equites cataphractarii, romanized peoples, and various mounted cultures in the west to form their own brand new 'Equites cataphractarii'. Unlike what some people mistakenly believe, the Auxilia 'Sarmatians', were last recorded in the area around the 300s and over time any cavalry traditions they taught would be forgotten.",
