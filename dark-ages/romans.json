Despite the fact that these units were rarely deployed in 'the west', many of them had very obviously Gaulish names. It wouldn't be especially  hard for retired Equites cataphractarii, romanized peoples, and various mounted cultures in the west to form their own brand new 'Equites cataphractarii'. Unlike what some people mistakenly believe, the Auxilia 'Sarmatians', were last recorded in the area around the 300s and over time any cavalry traditions they taught would be forgotten.",

Indeed, Emperor Zeno (Ruled 474-475) was an Isaurian himself. Despite the fact that within the military, barbarians and romans were increasing indistinguishable, the 'Romans' in Constantinople erupted into what was effectively a race riot in 475 (Which literally started in a chariot stadium..), during which they killed every Isaurian in the city. Zeno ended up ruling from 476 till 491, when he died of natural causes. A fellow Isaurian was not allowed to replace him (More sports fans race riots), and the resulting Isaurian revolt was crushed in 492.",
